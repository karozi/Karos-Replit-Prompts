# Karos-Replit-Prompts

Happy coding! 🚀 

This repo contains **non-destructive prompts** engineered for high-stakes, no-regression development, debugging and performance testing inside Replit environments.

The prompts are designed to unlock the full potential of AI-assisted development on Replit.

They leverage advanced techniques to help you build better projects, debug more effectively, and explore complex programming concepts.

I've used them while building [StackShelf](https://stackshelf.app/), see [repo](https://github.com/karozi/StackShelf.app).

## 🚀 Quick Start ##
Copy any prompt below and paste it into your Replit chat or AI assistant. These prompts are built to be used as-is, but if you need to, you can modify them to match your specific needs.
